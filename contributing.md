Here is a list of good rules of thumb for inclusion in this awesome list.

- The new link relates to OpenTofu
- In the case of software initially made for Terraform, it promises interoperability support with OpenTofu.
- Use the following format: `[Library](url) - Description.`
- Keep descriptions concise, clear and simple, and end them with a period/stop.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome.
- Proof-read yourself, check your spelling and grammar.
